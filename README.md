--ABOUT ME--
Hey there visitor! This is my personal GitHub page. I hope to be able to fill this with some of my largest school and personal projects as a portfolio for future work. Some of the work here is amatuer-ish as it might have been my first time doing a certain thing such as a full JavaFX application. I hope to use this profile as a place to also review how far I have come as a programmer, and as a showcase of how I can improve my code, coding habits and more.
