--ABOUT ME-- <br>
Welcome to my GitHub profile, this is where I put my personal and academic projects. I hope to work in either Game Development or UI/UX in the future. Here you can see the projects I have worked on, and perhaps how I may have improved over the years. The journey to learning is never-ending, there's always tons to learn about and I intend to do my best to familiarise myself with a wide variety of frameworks and languages. <br>
